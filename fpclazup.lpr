{ Code conventions in this project:
- comment as much as you can
- all variables with directories contain:
  no trailing delimiter (/ or \) and

}
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

{
Possible additional verifications: check existing fpc locations, versions

Command: tfplist or something containing log records with timestamp, sequence description

Add something like fpcup.config in the settings or installed fpc/lazarus dir so we know for which fpc/laz combo this dir is used
